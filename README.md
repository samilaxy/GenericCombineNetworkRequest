In the world of iOS development, networking is an essential aspect of any app. Whether you're connecting to a RESTful API or sending data to a server, networking is what allows your app to communicate with external services. As such, having a reliable and efficient networking layer is critical to the success of any iOS app.
What is a Generic Combine Networking Layer?
A generic Combine networking layer is a networking layer that uses the Combine framework to handle network requests. The layer is designed to be generic, meaning that it can be used with any API or backend service, as long as it follows a few basic conventions.
The core of the networking layer is a set of Combine publishers that represent network requests. These publishers are responsible for making the actual network requests and emitting events as the request progresses. For example, a publisher might emit a value when the request starts, another value when the request completes successfully, and an error value if the request fails.
